## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with functions, recursivity, lists, sets, dictionaries. 📚

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with Ocaml compiler (native or bytecode compiler) or they can be evaluated in the ocaml interpreter. 🐪

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL) // I do not recommend installing on Windows, it is not natively supported.
- Package Manager: Opam for Ocaml programming language and other packages.
- Programming Language: Ocaml
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

Personally, I made use of WSL with Visual Studio Code, and most of time i used the ocaml interpreter to evaluate my programs.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install opam and ocaml
   ```sh
   https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running
   ```

2. Install OCAML packages
   ```sh
   opam install merlin ocp-ident
   ```
   
3. Configure Visual Studio Code to run OCaml code.
   ```sh
   Install OCaml extenions from VSCode marketplace.
   ```
   
   ```sh
   I had to change the setting "ocaml.merlinPath": "ocamlmerlin", in the OCaml VSCode extension settings to "ocaml.merlinPath": "ocamlmerlin-server", to get the extension to work.
   ```
